\section{Purpose}\label{sec:purpose}

% TODO Johan: Rework. Make shorter. More purpose-oriented wording.

The purpose of this project is a cryptographically secured distributed peer-to-peer system for storage and communication of data. It should be bundled as a developer library with focus on modularity, decentralization and security. The goal is to determine if such a system can be implemented solely with web technologies and become usable for scenarios such as file sharing between clients.

The underlying requirements of the library was partially determined from section~\ref{sec:problem}:

\begin{description}
  \item[Privacy] Only users that are given explicit access to a resource should be able to deduce anything useful about its content. No central entity, such as a server administrator or network operator, should be able to extract incriminating information about a client. Users should be able to trust that they know who they are communicating with. No network operator or server administrator should be able to forge identities in a way that can not be detected by a user.

\item[Security] Encryption in each step, from resource storage to data transfer.

\item[Reliability] If any server goes down and can not be recovered, no damage should be done to the network as a whole as long as anyone can host a new server using the same source code.

\item[Modularization and agnosticism] The system as a whole should not depend on particular implementations for resource storage, key storage or which protocol to use for data transfer. If a developer wants to, they should be able to easily plug in their own alternative implementation module.

\end{description}
