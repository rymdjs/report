\section{Structure}
  \label{sec:structure}

Chapter~\ref{chap:methodology} describes the different parts of this project methodologywise. The main part of this report can be viewed as a three step process: a theoretical background; a design, evaluation and analysis chapter; and an implementation chapter.

In chapter~\ref{chap:tech_background}, fundamental information about relevant theories and technologies is given in order to supply the reader an understanding of the field. Chapter~\ref{chap:similar} surveys the current landscape and positions this project among other related work. An analysis and overall system design is described in chapter~\ref{chap:design} where the underlying modules are specified. The low-level implementations of these are described in chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}.

The final part of this report involves discussion and conclusion in chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} and \ref{chap:conclusion}, where the results of the project are presented and discussed.
