One of the main initial goals with Rymd was to make the system truly decentralized and independent of any web servers. The Shuttle application can be downloaded and run locally, and all data transfers between clients are performed in a peer-to-peer fashion. There is, however, two parts where communicatin with a central endpoint needs to be done:
\subsection{WebRTC ICE}
As described in section~\ref{sec:p2p}, establishing of WebRTC connections still relies on the availability of a STUN or TURN server. This makes implementing applications depend on the availability of such a server. However, there are several public ICE servers available and in the case of downtime it is trivial to set up a new one and make the application use the new server instead. Also, since verification of identities of peers is performed locally and all data is end-to-end encrypted, there is no possibility of the administrator of these servers to spoof identities or deduce anything about shared resources. The two things that do leak are identity names (since these are needed to deduce who to connect to whom) and, if TURN is used, estimated size of data transferred. We found no way around the former and found it to be a fair tradeoff - future implementations could 

\subsection{Accessing the DHT}
Since Namecoin (or any other currently existing cryptocurrency for that matter) communicates using their own binary data protocol\cite{BitcoinSource:2014:Online}, Rymd can not interact directly with the blockchain and fetch public keys for identities. Therefore, an HTTP gateway running the Namecoin software was developed that acts as a bridge between the blockchain and Rymd nodes. Trust in the operator of this gateway is crucial, since public keys are fetched and verified through it. The paranoid user could easily run their own gateway, or manually verify or insert public keys using their own Namecoin client. On May 6th, at the time of writing of this report, a public and more general HTTP/Blockchain interface at \emph{chain-api.com}\cite{Chain:2014:Online} was released. Currently it only support Bitcoin, but promises future integration with the Namecoin blockchain. Once that happens, it would be trivial to replace the current gateway with Chain if one would like to do so. The buzz around services like these shows that this is an emerging area.

Something that would both solve these issues and be very interesting in many other areas is a blockchain where nodes can communicate through open web protocols. This would mean that web clients could interact directly with the blockchain without interacting through gateways like these, at the same time allowing them to contribute to the network. Given the premises stated in the introduction and the rapid development of emerging blockchains and cryptocurrencies, we think it is only a matter of time before this happens.
