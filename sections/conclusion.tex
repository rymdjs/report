The scope of functionality that is included in open web standards is constantly widening and with this, so do the potentials and capabilities of modern web browsers. Some standards are still in their infancy. Most notably, the Web Crypto API is still in experimental state even in implementing browsers and lack vital parts such as secure key storage. More progress is needed before secure authenticated peer-to-peer file sharing can be done by web browser. Even so, Rymd and Shuttle show that this future might not be that far away. Even if the resulting code is not yet ready for production from a security perspective, we feel that our ambition to create a starting point for a web-centered secure file sharing platform has gone well. It is our hope that Rymd will get feedback from the community in order to inspire and play a part in a new wave of file sharing technologies on the web.
