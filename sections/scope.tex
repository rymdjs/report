The project will be scoped to encompass two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A library for dealing with encryption, storage and data transfer communication between clients.
\item A proof-of-concept prototype implementation (like a “front-end Dropbox” app) that runs in a modern web browser.
\end{itemize}
The system will not deal with version management, syncing, merging resources, and history. Neither will the upload of the users’ public encryption keys to the block chain be solved by Rymd, since it involves payment logistics – a subsystem not in our scope.

Leaking of certain kinds of metadata will not be addressed. Namely, information on who is communicating with whom, since this is a very difficult issue far beyond the scope of this project. Also, network operators will likely be able to make a rough estimate on resource size based on the amount of data transferred, since this is considered a reasonable privacy-performance tradeoff as long as transfers are padded enough that the estimation can only ever be so vague.

Some of the technologies involved in this project are quite recently developed, which means that some of even the latest browsers might lack support for some of them. The final product will most likely not work on all types of devices and browsers.
