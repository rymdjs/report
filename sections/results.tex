This project has resulted in a modular peer-to-peer developer library for sending data, encrypted with public-private encryption, over a secure connection to another client. The library, \emph{Rymd}, has composed several modules for specific areas such as data storage (section~\ref{sec:datastorage}), cryptography, (section~\ref{sec:cryptography}) and communication (section~\ref{sec:p2p}) in order to create a foundation for sending files without central file storage.

For demonstrating the capabilities of Rymd, a sample prototype web application has been created, named \emph{Shuttle}. This front facing client provides a user interface for showing local files, sending files to other users registered in the blockchain, and encryption key management.
