Rymd will be a JavaScript library for sharing files securely using web based peer-to-peer technology. Developers will be able to use the library to build web applications where users can make their files shareable with other users or devices. No user files will be stored on central servers. With help from modern web technologies, a decentralized approach to file sharing will be built as a general library, and packaged with a front-facing prototype (a “product”), demonstrating the features of the idea.
