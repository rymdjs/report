In a day and age where people all over the world own more than one digital device, the need for services which let users easily store, access, sync and share personal files has grown. Thanks to the Internet, it is possible to store data “in the cloud” and access it from a web browser or a designated client. Instead of storing files on physical media, it is today a common practice to use services like Dropbox, Google Drive or Apple’s iCloud for home and business matters. In November 2013, Dropbox hit 200 million users (Constine 2013). Google Drive is integrated across a large number of Google’s products, as is the case with Apple’s iCloud, which stores and syncs personal preferences across devices and applications.

The existing mainstream services mentioned above are centralized, which means the files and resources are stored on central servers somewhere on the Internet. This report will describe the results of developing a decentralized file sharing system with focus on security and open web standards.
