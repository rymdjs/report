This thesis describes the development of a cryptographically secured decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing system, bundled as a JavaScript developer library. We evaluate current web technologies and determine if they are sufficient to implement such a system. The Namecoin blockchain is used for storing user identities mapped to their public encryption keys, which in turn are used to encrypt data. The results are illustrated by using the system to create a web application in which users can store and share files easily. 

By making the system highly modular, we manage to achieve satisfying results in reliability and technical agnosticism with regards to underlying implementations.

Even though this project succeeds with its goal of creating a client-side file sharing platform, standards bodies and browser vendors still have work to do within the area of cryptography for the web.
