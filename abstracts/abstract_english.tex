This Bachelor's thesis describes the development of a decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing system, bundled as a Javascript developer library. Through evaluations the project determines if it is possible to implement such a system solely with current web technologies. The Namecoin blockchain is used for storing user identities mapped to their public encryption keys, which in turn are used to encrypt data. The end result is a web application where a user can share a file securely with another user completely with peer-to-peer technology.

The final product also includes a front-end prototype is built to show the features of the library. By making the system highly modular (the code split into many separate modules), we manage to achieve satisfying results in reliability and technical agnosticism in terms of underlying implementations.

Even though this project succeeds with its goal of creating a client-side file sharing library, there are still advancements to be made within the area of cryptography for the web.
